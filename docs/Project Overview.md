# Kirishima Project Overview

This document provides a complete technical summary of the Kirishima architecture for internal reference. It defines the role of each component, how services interact, and where responsibilities are clearly divided.

## üîß System Summary

Kirishima is a modular service-oriented architecture powered by FastAPI and coordinated through a central reasoning engine known as **Brain**.

The system is designed to:
- Interface with a local LLM through an isolated proxy layer.
- Handle structured memory via ChromaDB.
- Support time-based task scheduling, contact resolution, multi-protocol message handling, and summarization pipelines.
- Enable multi-service reasoning, orchestration, and dynamic context management.

All services run locally and communicate over defined ports using HTTP.

---

## üß† Core Principles

- **Brain is the sole orchestrator.** All cross-service logic and dispatch is routed through Brain.
- **Only the Proxy service may interact with the LLM.** This includes both completions and prompt scaffolding.
- **Summarize is only called by Brain.** No direct LLM calls or summary triggers outside Brain are permitted.
- **Database access should be routed through Brain.** Exceptions are documented.
- **All services must log debug and error output to Graylog.** Observability is mandatory.

## üß© Active Components

### üîÅ [[API]]
- Entry point for OpenAI-compatible clients (e.g., `/chat/completions`)
- Forwards messages to Brain via `/message/incoming`
- Previously managed logic but now functions as a lightweight adapter layer

### üß† [[Brain]]
- Central coordination service
- Handles:
  - Buffer management
  - Mode switching
  - Memory CRUD
  - Summarization triggers
  - Scheduler job dispatch
  - Contact resolution
  - Outbound communication routing
- Only Brain talks to Summarize or Proxy

### üìö [[Summarize]]
- Receives summarization tasks from Brain
- Supports two modes:
  - Long-form: email, dense input
  - Short-form: rolling chat buffers
- Triggers summarization based on token count thresholds
- Stores summaries in ChromaDB

### üß¨ [[ChromaDB]]
- Vector-based semantic store
- Used for:
  - Memory embedding and search
  - Summary recall and user-specific context
- Write access currently allowed to Summarize and Brain only

### ‚è± [[Scheduler]]
- Triggers time-based events
- No logic of its own‚Äîjust invokes Brain
- Supports scheduled buffer summarization and reminders

### üìá [[Contacts]]
- Stores cross-platform contact identity records
- Provides alias resolution, search, metadata
- Queried by Brain to match incoming messages to known identities

### üí¨ [[iMessage]]
- Receives webhook pushes from BlueBubbles
- Sends and receives messages via HTTP API
- Forwards messages to Brain, preserving origin metadata
- Outbound texts are routed back through this service

### üß† [[Proxy]]
- Exclusive interface to local LLM (e.g., Ollama)
- All completions and prompt scaffolding must go through here
- Exposes `/from/{platform}` and `/to/{platform}` for platform-aware context handling
