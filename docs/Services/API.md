# üåê API

## Purpose

Serves as the bridge between OpenAI-compatible clients and the internal reasoning system (Brain via Ollama). It exposes standardized `/chat/completions` and `/completions` endpoints, wraps function-calling logic, and manages prompt construction, context injection, memory access, and user interaction scaffolding.

## Port

4200

## Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `POST /chat/completions` ‚Äì Stateful, multi-turn conversations with full memory and buffer context (primary user interface)
- `POST /completions` ‚Äì Stateless one-shot completion (used by subsystems or integrations)

### Function Dispatch

- `POST /function` ‚Äì Receives function-style requests and routes them through `functions.py`

### Supporting

- `POST /scheduler` ‚Äì Job registration and handling (relays to Brain/Scheduler)
- `POST /upload` ‚Äì Handle file uploads
- `POST /embeddings` ‚Äì Embedding generation (Ollama-wrapped)
- `POST /chromadb_search` ‚Äì Semantic memory search
- `GET /models` / `GET /model/(name)` ‚Äì Model management

## Function Modules

- `functions.py` ‚Äì Master dispatcher for system-defined callable logic
- `memory_functions.py` ‚Äì Handles `create_memory` and `delete_memory`
- `mode.py` ‚Äì Get/set mode (‚ö†Ô∏è bug: currently doesn't contact Brain)
- `buffer.py` ‚Äì Interface for short-term conversational state
- `system.py` ‚Äì Returns platform and instance metadata

## Responsibilities

- Normalize OpenAI-compatible interface

## Known Issues

- Mode switching via `mode.py` is not synced with Brain (fix planned)
- Some endpoints (e.g., completions) previously outdated, now corrected
- Function routing may need validation against memory state tracking logic

## External Dependencies

- Brain
- Proxy
- ChromaDB (via Brain)
- Scheduler (via Brain)
